"/big-o","Big O","2A","Algorithm Analysis","Brian goes over how to measure how efficient an algorithm and the tools we have to measure it","flask"
"/spatial-complexity","Spatial Complexity","2B","Algorithm Analysis","Brian talks about Big O as it's applied to how much space something needs",
"/trade-offs","Trade Offs","2C","Algorithm Analysis","Brian goes over why we use Big O and the art of making trade offs",
"/bubble-sort","Bubble Sort","3A","Iterative Sorts","Starting from basics, Brian teaches how to sort items in a list using the classic simple sorting algorithm, the bubble sort.","redo"
"/insertion-sort","Insertion Sort","3B","Iterative Sorts","A more useful tool, insertion sort is a tool that developers will occasionally use. Brian goes over why that is and how to do it",
"/recursion","Recursion","4A","Recursive Sorts","Brian defines recursion as something that recurses. In this section Brian teaches what recursion is and some places you might use it.","sitemap"
"/merge-sort","Merge Sort","4B","Recursive Sorts","One of the most versatile and useful sorts, merge sorts has wide applications due to its stabilitiy and reliability for sorting.",
"/quick-sort","Quick Sort","4C","Recursive Sorts","A sort that has a better best case than merge sort, quick sort is frequently used as well. Brian teaches you all you need to know to add this to your algorithm toolbox.",
