This course is a long one and definitely not one to take lightly. Don't expect all of this to sink in instantly, and certainly don't expect to have perfect recall of these. Even though I've learned these concepts many times, taught them many time, and even taught this very course a few times I <em>still</em> have to look them up when I use them. The point isn't to have a perfect recall of them, it's to learn new ways of solving problems.</p>\n<p>More than anything, I hope you took away the science of trading off. Sometimes you want go for raw performance, sometimes you want to use as little memory as possible, and frequently it's somewhere in the middle. More than anything, I hope you choose to write clean, readable code. If you take away nothing else, it's that: readable code is almost always the goal. Performance is secondary to that. Human time is nearly always more valuable than computer time. Spend time trying to solve problems for your clients and customers and writing code that you can maintain and less on pointless optimizations that likely won't make any difference to your users. Only when you need to get raw performance should you trade off the needs of maintainence and customers.</p>\n<p>Thank you for sticking with me! I hope you enjoyed the course and I will catch you again soon!!</p>\n<p>&#x3C;3 â€“ Brian</p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/wrap-up","title":"Wrap Up","order":"11A","section":"Conclusion","description":""}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7A","path":"/arraylist","title":"ArrayList"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8B","path":"/avl-tree","title":"AVL Tree"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2A","path":"/big-o","title":"Big O"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8A","path":"/binary-search-tree","title":"Binary Search Tree"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"6A","path":"/binary-search","title":"Binary Search"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"10A","path":"/bloom-filters","title":"Bloom Filters"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8D","path":"/breadth-first-tree-traversals","title":"Breadth-First Tree Traversals"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3A","path":"/bubble-sort","title":"Bubble Sort"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8C","path":"/depth-first-tree-traversals","title":"Depth-First Tree Traversals"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"1B","path":"/exercises","title":"The Exercises"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"9A","path":"/graphs","title":"Graphs"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"8E","path":"/heap-sort","title":"Heap Sort"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"3B","path":"/insertion-sort","title":"Insertion Sort"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"1A","path":"/intro","title":"Introduction"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"7B","path":"/linkedlist","title":"LinkedList"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4B","path":"/merge-sort","title":"Merge Sort"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"9B","path":"/pathfinding","title":"Pathfinding"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4C","path":"/quick-sort","title":"Quick Sort"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"5A","path":"/radix-sort","title":"Radix Sort"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"4A","path":"/recursion","title":"Recursion"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2B","path":"/spatial-complexity","title":"Spatial Complexity"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"2C","path":"/trade-offs","title":"Trade Offs"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"9C","path":"/tries","title":"Tries"}}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"order":"11A","path":"/wrap-up","title":"Wrap Up"}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["2959687377"]}
